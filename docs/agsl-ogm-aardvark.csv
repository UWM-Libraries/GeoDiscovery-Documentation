**[Title](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#title)**,dct_title_s,"We use Madison's filenaming convention, e.g. ""Parks Milwaukee County, Wisconsin 2009"". Some use a date range. *Geography_Theme_Year*"

**[Access Rights](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#access-rights)**,dct_accessRights_s,"Public or Restricted. How can we use to differentiate between UW and UWM restriction?? Or should we use ""rights"" for that?"
**[ID](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#id)**,id,"This field makes up the URL for the resource in GeoBlacklight. It is visible to the user and is used to create permalinks. If having a readable slug is desired, it is common to use the form institution-keyword1-keyword2."
**[Modified](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#modified)**,gbl_mdModified_dt,This value should indicate when the metadata (not the resource itself) was last modified.
**[Metadata Version](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#metadata-version)**,gbl_mdVersion_s,There have been two metadata schema versions for GeoBlacklight applications: GeoBlacklight 1.0 (abbreviated to GBL 1.0) and OpenGeoMetadata Aardvark (abbreviated to Aardvark).

[Temporal Coverage](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#temporal-coverage),dct_temporal_sm,"We're storing an ISO date here, but it is intedned to be human readable. Maybe we should rethink this one?"
[Date Issued](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#date-issued),dct_issued_s,"This fills the ""Date Issued"" field on the show page."
[Index Year](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#index-year),gbl_indexYear_im,"The ""main"" year. Doesn't appear to the user except in the Year facet. Should be the same as year in the title (not for range?)"
[Spatial Coverage](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#spatial-coverage),dct_spatial_sm,"Spatial Keywords, e.g. ""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""Portland Metro"", etc. These get shown to the user and linked to the ""place"" facet."

[Bounding Box](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#bounding-box),dcat_bbox,"Should also be WENS, overlap ratio boosting in spatial searches."
[Rights](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/#rights_1),dct_rights_sm,"We use our standard ""please see"" link and standard language about digital colelctions and copyright. OGM specifies it should be used for more free text description of access rights, etc. Could expand beyond current boilerplate use."
