## GeoBlacklight

Open-source, Ruby on Rails software application for discovery geospatial content based on the open-source software project Blacklight.

see [geoblacklight.org](https://geoblacklight.org/)

{: .note }
Blacklight and GeoBlacklight are unlike many Ruby on Rails applications in that they use Apache Solr as a data store rather than a relational database.

## Blacklight 

An open-source, Ruby on Rails engine that provides a basic discovery interface for searching an Apache Solr index, including fielded searching, applyying and removing facet constraints, sorting and paginating through search results, and more.

see [projectblacklight.org](http://projectblacklight.org/)

## Ruby on Rails

Sever-side web application framework written in Ruby that uses the MVC Framework (model-view-controller). Popular websites like GitHub, Twitch, and AirBNB are built using Ruby on Rails.

see [rubyonrails.org](https://rubyonrails.org/)

## Apache Solr

PAn open-source enterprise-search platform written in Java. Features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration, and rich document handling.

see [solr.apache.org](https://solr.apache.org/)

Blacklight and GeoBlacklight use Solr as a data store. Metadata is ingested and indexed in Solr.
